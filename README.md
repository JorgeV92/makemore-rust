# MakeMore in Rust 



# Karpathy’s Transformer to Rust – Plan & Resource Guide

## Overview 
This guide outlines a step-by-step plan to implement Andrej Karpathy’s **Makemore Transformer** (a GPT-style character-level language model) in Rust. We will focus exclusively on the Transformer model (ignoring bigrams, RNNs, etc.) and incorporate **GPU acceleration** to leverage modern hardware. The emphasis is on **learning** – we’ll discuss when to use existing Rust crates versus implementing features from scratch to maximize understanding. We’ll also cover practical aspects like model architecture, training loops, data loading, text sampling, logging (TensorBoard-style), project structure, and relevant Rust resources as of 2025.

## Understanding the Transformer Architecture 
Karpathy’s Makemore Transformer is essentially a miniature GPT-2. Before coding, let’s clarify its components:

- **Embedding Layers**: The model uses a **token embedding** (to turn input characters into vectors) and a **positional embedding** (to give each sequence position a vector, so order is encoded). In Makemore, both are learnable lookup tables ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=wte%20%3D%20nn)).
- **Transformer Blocks**: The network stacks multiple identical blocks (e.g. *n_layer* blocks). Each block contains:
  - **Causal Self-Attention** – a multi-head self-attention layer that looks at earlier positions in the sequence (masked to preserve autoregressive order).
  - **Feed-Forward MLP** – an inner two-layer network applied to each position (often with 4× the embedding size hidden dimension and a GELU activation, as in GPT-2 ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=self))).
  - **Residual Connections & LayerNorm** – each sub-layer (attention or MLP) is preceded by layer normalization and followed by adding the input (residual skip connection) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=self)) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=def%20forward)).
- **Output Layer**: After the final block, a final layer normalization and a linear layer map the Transformer outputs to logits over the vocabulary (for predicting the next character) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=h%20%3D%20nn.ModuleList%28,n_layer)).

**Causal Masking**: The self-attention is “masked” so that each position can only attend to earlier (left-side) positions. In PyTorch, Karpathy achieved this by a lower-triangular matrix of ones (stored as a buffer) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=,left%20in%20the%20input%20sequence)) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=att%20%3D%20%28q%20%40%20k.transpose%28,1)). This mask prevents the model from seeing future characters during training.

**Recap:** At a high level, given an input sequence of characters, the Transformer: (1) embeds characters and positions, (2) passes them through multiple self-attention + MLP layers (with residuals), (3) normalizes and projects to output logits for the next character probabilities. We will reimplement this same architecture in Rust, reusing the proven design (no need to invent new architecture) – the main changes will be in coding it with Rust idioms and integrating GPU support.

## Rust Libraries and Tools: Crate Choices vs. From-Scratch

Rust’s ecosystem now offers several options for machine learning and GPU computing. We need to decide how much to lean on libraries versus low-level implementation. Below is a comparison of approaches, with recommendations:

| **Approach**              | **Description**                                              | **Pros**                                                      | **Cons**                                                      | **Use When**                                   |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Using `tch` crate**     | Leverage the `tch` crate (Rust bindings to PyTorch’s C++ API) ([Choosing the Right Rust Machine Learning Framework: Candle, Burn, DFDX, or tch-rs? | by Athan X | Medium](https://medium.com/@athan.seal/choosing-the-right-rust-machine-learning-framework-candle-burn-dfdx-or-tch-rs-17501f6cd765#:~:text=tch,and%20Python%20for%20ML%20applications)) for tensors, autograd, and GPU.| - High-level API similar to PyTorch (easy transition). <br>- Automatic GPU acceleration (built on CUDA/cuDNN). <br>- Autograd and optimizers (Adam, etc.) available out-of-the-box. <br>- Access to PyTorch’s efficient kernels and pretrained model compatibility. | - Large dependency (requires libtorch). <br>- Less “native Rust” feel (many APIs mirror PyTorch). <br>- Hides low-level GPU details (less hands-on GPU learning). | You want a quick, working Transformer with minimal fuss, while still coding in Rust. Also great if you want to leverage PyTorch’s robustness or compare with Python. |
| **Using `burn` crate**    | Use the **Burn** framework – a pure Rust deep learning library with multiple backend options (CPU, **WGPU** for GPU, or even `tch` backend) ([Oh great! I am one of the contributors for Burn (Rust Deep Learning ...](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471362#:~:text=Oh%20great%21%20I%20am%20one,with%20ability%20to%20swap%20backends)) ([  Rust Burn Library for Deep Learning - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/rust-burn-library-for-deep-learning#:~:text=This%20will%20install%20the%20Burn,level%20GPU%20operations)).| - Pure Rust implementation; no Python required. <br>- Supports GPU via **WebGPU** (portable, works on various GPUs) ([  Rust Burn Library for Deep Learning - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/rust-burn-library-for-deep-learning#:~:text=This%20will%20install%20the%20Burn,level%20GPU%20operations)). <br>- Full training loop utilities, metrics, logging, and checkpointing built-in ([  Rust Burn Library for Deep Learning - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/rust-burn-library-for-deep-learning#:~:text=,Small%20but%20active%20developer%20community)). <br>- Design emphasizes flexibility and backend-agnostic code (learn modern Rust ML patterns). | - Still evolving (smaller community than PyTorch). <br>- Documentation is improving but less extensive than PyTorch’s. <br>- Performance tuning is ongoing (though rapidly improving). | You want to learn by using a Rust-native ML stack and possibly experiment with GPU via WebGPU. Great for understanding how a Rust ML framework is structured, while still having conveniences (like logging and metrics). |
| **Using `ndarray` (+ custom autograd)** | Build the model using low-level tensors/arrays (e.g. the `ndarray` crate for N-D arrays) and implement training manually (or use an autograd helper crate like `rust-autograd` built on ndarray ([NickLucche/autograd.rs: Simple Deep Learning library in ... - GitHub](https://github.com/NickLucche/autograd.rs#:~:text=NickLucche%2Fautograd,ndarray%20crate%20to%20execute))). | - Maximum transparency: you handle matrix multiplications, softmax, etc. and truly grasp the math. <br>- Lightweight – only bring in what you need (e.g. `ndarray` for linear algebra). <br>- **Great learning value**: forces understanding of forward and backward passes. | - Requires writing or integrating an autograd engine (to compute gradients) – more complex to get right. <br>- No built-in GPU support – computations are on CPU unless you write GPU kernels yourself. <br>- Slower to develop and potentially slower execution for large models (if not highly optimized). | You prioritize learning over performance. Ideal for prototyping a tiny Transformer to fully understand it. You might start with this on CPU to grasp the details, then switch to a higher-level or GPU-enabled approach. |
| **Writing custom GPU code** | Write your own GPU kernels or shaders (using technologies like **CUDA** with crates like `cust`, or **WebGPU** via the `wgpu` crate) for operations like matrix multiply or attention. | - **Deep GPU programming experience** – learn how to marshal data to GPU, write shaders or kernels, and optimize memory access. <br>- Full control over performance optimizations and precision. | - Extremely time-consuming and advanced. You’d be re-implementing what libraries already provide. <br>- Need to handle a lot of boilerplate (compiling shaders, managing GPU memory, etc.). <br>- Risk of getting bogged down in GPU details instead of model logic. | This is an optional path *if* you’re specifically interested in GPU programming for its own sake. For example, after getting a working model with `tch` or `burn`, you might try writing a custom GPU kernel for the attention mechanism as a learning exercise. Not recommended for the initial end-to-end implementation due to complexity. |

**Recommendation:** Start with either `tch` or `burn` for the main implementation so you can train on GPU and verify the model’s correctness. These will handle a lot of the heavy lifting (GPU tensor ops, autograd, etc.) while still allowing you to implement the model architecture manually. Both approaches will significantly accelerate training on GPUs compared to a pure CPU implementation. If your goal is maximum learning, you could first do a simplified CPU prototype with `ndarray` or even the **femtoGPT** approach (a pure-Rust minimal GPT library ([Train your own minimal GPT language model in Rust | by Keyvan Kambakhsh | GoPenAI](https://blog.gopenai.com/train-your-own-minimal-gpt-language-model-in-rust-b53a9177973a#:~:text=operations%20and%20Rust%E2%80%99s%20native%20math,small%20GPT%20models%20on%20CPU))) to solidify your understanding, and then progress to using `tch` or `burn` for the real training run on GPU. This way, you combine low-level insight with high-performance execution.

## Project Setup and Dependencies

**1. Create a new Rust project:** Use Cargo to set up a new binary crate. For example: 

```bash
cargo new rust_makemore --bin
```

This will create a `Cargo.toml` and a `src/main.rs`. We will organize the project into multiple source files shortly (see [Project Structure](#project-structure) below).

**2. Choose and add dependencies:** Depending on the approach, include the appropriate crates in `Cargo.toml`:

- **If using tch (PyTorch bindings):** Add `tch = "0.*"` to dependencies. Make sure to have the correct version of **libtorch** installed. The `tch` crate’s docs guide you to download the libtorch library (the crate will look for it). For GPU support, use the CUDA-enabled libtorch (and set `TORCH_CUDA_VERSION` env var accordingly, e.g. `11.8` or `12.1` matching your CUDA). This gives you access to `tch::Tensor` and `tch::nn` for building the model and running it on GPU (CUDA).  ([Choosing the Right Rust Machine Learning Framework: Candle, Burn, DFDX, or tch-rs? | by Athan X | Medium](https://medium.com/@athan.seal/choosing-the-right-rust-machine-learning-framework-candle-burn-dfdx-or-tch-rs-17501f6cd765#:~:text=tch,and%20Python%20for%20ML%20applications))

- **If using burn (Rust-native):** Add `burn = "0.*"` and also add the desired backend feature. For GPU via WebGPU, enable the `wgpu` feature. For example: `burn = { version = "0.X", features = ["wgpu"] }`. This will pull in Burn and its WGPU backend, allowing GPU execution via Vulkan/Metal/DirectX (no CUDA required) ([  Rust Burn Library for Deep Learning - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/rust-burn-library-for-deep-learning#:~:text=This%20will%20install%20the%20Burn,level%20GPU%20operations)). Burn’s modular design also allows a `burn-tch` backend (to use PyTorch under the hood) ([Oh great! I am one of the contributors for Burn (Rust Deep Learning ...](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35471362#:~:text=Oh%20great%21%20I%20am%20one,with%20ability%20to%20swap%20backends)), but since the goal is to learn GPU programming, the WGPU backend is a good choice.

- **If implementing with ndarray:** Add `ndarray = "0.15"` for n-dimensional array support on CPU. You may also add `ndarray-rand` for random initialization and perhaps `rust-autograd = "0.1"` (or another autograd crate) if you want automatic differentiation on top of ndarray ([NickLucche/autograd.rs: Simple Deep Learning library in ... - GitHub](https://github.com/NickLucche/autograd.rs#:~:text=NickLucche%2Fautograd,ndarray%20crate%20to%20execute)). Another interesting crate is **dfdx** (if you discover it, it’s a pure Rust autograd framework that can target CUDA). These are optional – you could also manually compute gradients for a small model as an exercise.

- **Common utilities:** Regardless of approach, add `rand = "0.8"` (for random number generation, e.g. sampling characters), and for logging you can add `tensorboard-rs = "0.2"` (a crate to log TensorBoard events). If using `burn`, note it already has logging support built-in ([  Rust Burn Library for Deep Learning - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/rust-burn-library-for-deep-learning#:~:text=,Small%20but%20active%20developer%20community)), but using `tensorboard-rs` or an external tool is fine too.

After adding dependencies, run `cargo build` to ensure everything compiles and to download the libraries.

**3. Project structure:** Plan to separate code into modules for clarity. For example, you might have a `model.rs` for the Transformer architecture, a `dataset.rs` for data loading utilities, a `train.rs` for the training loop, etc. This is not strictly required, but organizing code will make it easier to manage as the project grows. (A suggested structure is given in the [Project Structure](#project-structure) section.)

**4. GPU setup validation:** Ensure your environment can see the GPU:
- If using `tch` + CUDA: Verify that `tch::Device::cuda_is_available()` returns true at runtime. You might need to set up library paths so that the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN libraries are found by libtorch.
- If using `burn` + WGPU: No special driver other than a Vulkan/Metal-compatible GPU driver is needed. Burn will use `wgpu` internally. You may want to test a simple tensor operation on GPU (see Burn’s docs or run a small example like elementwise addition to ensure it executes without error on GPU) ([  Rust Burn Library for Deep Learning - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/rust-burn-library-for-deep-learning#:~:text=use%20burn%3A%3Atensor%3A%3ATensor%3B%20use%20burn%3A%3Abackend%3A%3AWgpuBackend%3B)) ([  Rust Burn Library for Deep Learning - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/rust-burn-library-for-deep-learning#:~:text=let%20tensor_2%20%3D%20Tensor%3A%3A%3A%3Aones_like)).

*Note:* Using **WebGPU (via wgpu)** has the advantage of working on non-NVIDIA GPUs and even on the CPU (with a Vulkan software rasterizer) if needed. CUDA via `tch` will generally yield the best performance on NVIDIA cards (leveraging cuDNN kernels ([Choosing the Right Rust Machine Learning Framework: Candle, Burn, DFDX, or tch-rs? | by Athan X | Medium](https://medium.com/@athan.seal/choosing-the-right-rust-machine-learning-framework-candle-burn-dfdx-or-tch-rs-17501f6cd765#:~:text=Candle%3A%20Simplicity%20and%20High,efficient%20execution%20on%20NVIDIA%20GPUs))), but it ties you to NVIDIA hardware. Either way, by 2025 both approaches are mature: choose the one that aligns best with your learning goals and hardware.

## Implementing the Model Components 

We will now implement the Transformer model in Rust, mirroring Karpathy’s architecture. The plan is to create our own `Transformer` struct with the same submodules (embedding layers, attention blocks, etc.), using the chosen crate’s operations. Below we break down the components and how to implement each in Rust.

### 1. **Vocabulary and Embeddings** 
**Vocabulary:** First, define how to map characters to integers and back. In the dataset (e.g. `names.txt` of baby names), gather all unique characters (likely lowercase letters plus the newline or special start/end tokens). Create a mapping like `{char: index}` and `{index: char}`. This gives us `vocab_size`. In code, you might have a `HashMap<char, usize>` for char-to-index and a vector or array for index-to-char.

**Token Embedding:** Use a learnable embedding matrix of shape `(vocab_size, n_embd)`. In PyTorch, this was `nn.Embedding` ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=self)). In Rust:
  - With `tch`: you can create an embedding layer via `nn::embedding(p / "tok_emb", vocab_size, n_embd, Default::default())` which returns an `nn::Embedding` module. Under the hood, this is just a trainable `Tensor` of shape `[vocab_size, n_embd]` and a lookup operation.
  - With `burn`: use `burn::model::embed::Embedding` (Burn provides embedding layers) or simply treat it as a parameter `Tensor` of shape `[vocab_size, d_model]` and use the `.gather` or indexing operation to lookup. Burn’s high-level API would manage gradients for you.
  - If manual with `ndarray`: represent this as an `Array2<f32>` of shape `(vocab_size, n_embd)` and an indexing function that given an index returns the corresponding row (which is the embedding vector). You’ll need to update this matrix with gradients during training.

**Positional Embedding:** Makemore used learned positional embeddings (`nn.Embedding` for positions 0..block_size-1) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=wte%20%3D%20nn)). This is a vector for each position in the input sequence (up to the maximum context length). We will do the same:
  - With `tch`: you can initialize a tensor of shape `[1, block_size, n_embd]` (as in the tch example code) and mark it as a trainable parameter (`vs.zeros("pos_emb", &[1, block_size, n_embd])` gives a trainable tensor of zeros as initial pos embedding) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=Default%3A%3Adefault)).
  - Burn likely allows a similar approach or has a built-in positional embedding struct.
  - If implementing manually, an `Array2<f32>` of shape `(block_size, n_embd)` can store positional vectors. Initialize it (e.g. small random values or zeros). It will be learned during training.

During the forward pass, given an input sequence of length `t`, you will:
  - Convert characters to their indices (size `t`).
  - Look up the token embedding for each character (resulting in a `[t, n_embd]` array for a single example, or `[batch, t, n_embd]` for a batch).
  - Slice the first `t` positional embeddings (from pos 0 to pos t-1) from the positional embedding matrix. This yields a `[t, n_embd]` (or `[1, t, n_embd]` broadcastable) array.
  - Sum the token and positional embeddings elementwise to get the initial input to the Transformer blocks ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=pos%20%3D%20torch,shape%20%281%2C%20t)) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=x%20%3D%20tok_emb%20%2B%20pos_emb)). (This sum is also a learned operation, effectively allowing the model to use position info.)

### 2. **Causal Self-Attention Layer** 
This is the core of the Transformer’s power. We will implement a **multi-head self-attention** that is masked for causality (no looking ahead). Key steps to implement:

**Dimensions and Shapes:** Suppose `n_embd =  e` and number of heads = `h` (from config). Each head will have size `head_size = e / h` (assume `e` divisible by `h`). For a batch of size `B` and sequence length `T`:
- Input to attention: tensor of shape `[B, T, e]`.
- We create query, key, value projections: each is a linear transformation from `e` -> `e` (i.e., `e x e` weight matrix). In code, it’s convenient to do this as one combined projection to `3*e` and then split into 3 parts ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=,heads%2C%20but%20in%20a%20batch)) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=q%2C%20k%20%2Cv%20%3D%20self,dim%3D2)). For example, `W_qkv` weight of shape `(e, 3e)` applied to input gives `[B, T, 3e]`, then split into `q, k, v` each `[B, T, e]`.
  - With `tch`: one can create `c_attn = nn::linear(p / "c_attn", e, 3*e, Default::default())` to get the combined projection (as done in Karpathy’s code). After applying it, use `Tensor.split(e, dim=2)` to split into Q, K, V  ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=q%2C%20k%20%2Cv%20%3D%20self,dim%3D2)).
  - Burn or others: similarly, define linear layers or a combined one. Burn’s nn API likely has linear layers or you can use its tensor ops to slice.
  - Manual: multiply input matrix by weight matrices for Q, K, V separately (or one big weight and then split the result).

- Reshape Q, K, V to separate heads: We transform each of q, k, v from shape `[B, T, e]` to `[B, h, T, head_size]`. This can be done by `reshape` (or `view`) and `transpose`. For example, in PyTorch: 
  ```python
  q = q.view(B, T, h, head_size).transpose(1, 2)  # shape [B, h, T, head_size]
  ``` 
  Do the same for k and v ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=q%2C%20k%20%2Cv%20%3D%20self,dim%3D2)). In Rust/tch, you can use `.view([B, T, h, head_size]).transpose(1, 2)` to achieve this.

- Compute attention scores: We perform matrix multiplication of `q` and `k^T` for each head. Specifically, for each head, we take `Q_i` of shape `[B, T, head_size]` and `K_i` of shape `[B, T, head_size]` and compute attention scores `A_i = Q_i * K_i^T` which yields `[B, T, T]` (each element is dot product of a query vector with a key vector) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=att%20%3D%20%28q%20%40%20k.transpose%28,1)). In code, this can be `att = q.matmul(&k.transpose(-2, -1)) * (1.0 / sqrt(head_size))` ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20q.matmul%28%26k.transpose%28,3%5D%20as%20f64)). The multiplication by `1/sqrt(head_size)` is the scaling factor from the Transformer paper (prevents large dot products).

- Apply the causal mask: We need to set positions where j > i (future positions) to a large negative value (so that after softmax they become zero). We have a mask matrix of shape `[T, T]` that is 1 for allowed (j <= i) and 0 for disallowed. Expand it to `[1, 1, T, T]` (so it can apply to each batch and head) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=,left%20in%20the%20input%20sequence)). In tch, you can precompute this once: `mask = Tensor::ones(&[block_size, block_size], kind).tril(0)` and then during forward do `att.masked_fill(&mask.i((.., ..T, ..T)).eq(0), -Inf)` ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20q.matmul%28%26k.transpose%28,3%5D%20as%20f64)). This sets future positions to -∞. Ensure to only take first T positions of the mask for the given sequence length. After masking, apply softmax on the last dimension to get attention weights that sum to 1 for each query position ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=att%20%3D%20%28q%20%40%20k.transpose%28,1)). Optionally apply dropout to the attention matrix for regularization (e.g. `att.dropout(attn_dropout_prob)` in training ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=match%20at%20L781%20let%20att,1%2C%20Kind%3A%3AFloat%29.dropout%28cfg.attn_pdrop%2C%20train)) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20att.softmax%28,train))).

- Compute weighted values: Multiply the softmax output with the value vectors: `Y_i = softmax_att_i @ V_i`. This yields shape `[B, T, head_size]` for each head ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=att%20%3D%20%28q%20%40%20k.transpose%28,1)). Then we transpose and reshape back to `[B, T, e]` by concatenating all heads ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=y%20%3D%20att%20%40%20v,B%2C%20nh%2C%20T%2C%20hs)) (essentially the inverse of the earlier reshape). In tch: `y = att.matmul(&v)` gives `[B, h, T, head_size]`, then `y.transpose(1, 2).reshape([B, T, e])` to combine heads ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=y%20%3D%20att%20%40%20v,B%2C%20nh%2C%20T%2C%20hs)).

- Output linear: Finally, we have an output projection (another linear layer of shape `(e, e)`) applied to the combined heads output ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=)). This `c_proj` layer mixes information from different heads. With tch or burn, define `c_proj = nn::linear(p/"c_proj", e, e)`. With manual, this is another matrix multiply.

All of the above operations should be vectorized (no Python/Rust loops over positions or heads – use tensor ops to leverage GPU parallelism). The `tch` crate, for example, offers all these operations (`matmul`, `transpose`, `softmax`, `masked_fill`) which execute via optimized backend (CUDA or CPU). In Burn, you would use similar tensor operations (the Burn tensor API should have comparable functions).

**Summary:** The CausalSelfAttention module in Rust will hold the trainable parameters: the combined W_qkv weights (and bias if used) and W_proj (and bias), plus possibly a precomputed mask tensor. Its `forward` method will implement: project QKV -> split heads -> apply mask & softmax -> combine heads -> final linear ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20q.matmul%28%26k.transpose%28,3%5D%20as%20f64)) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20att.softmax%28,train)). We are essentially reusing Karpathy’s logic, just expressing it in Rust. 

### 3. **Feed-Forward MLP with GELU Activation**
After the attention, each Transformer block has a point-wise feed-forward network. In Makemore, this is a two-layer MLP applied to each position separately (same weights for all positions, thanks to weight sharing in the linear ops):
- Input and output size: `n_embd` (so it can be added back to the residual).
- Hidden size: typically `4 * n_embd` (GPT-2 used this factor) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=self)).
- Activation: Gaussian Linear Units (GELU), which is used in GPT-2/BERT ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=Implementation%20of%20the%20GELU%20activation,identical%20to%20OpenAI%20GPT)). GELU is like a smoother ReLU; PyTorch has it built-in (`torch.nn.functional.gelu`). In Rust, 
  - tch: you can use `tensor.gelu("none")` (the `"none"` is a legacy parameter in libtorch for approximation – "none" means exact formula) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20ys%20%3D)).
  - Burn: likely provides `burn::nn::Gelu` or you can implement the formula (Burn’s math support is good, they might have an activation you can plug in).
  - Manual: implement GELU using the formula *0.5 * x * (1 + tanh(√(2/π) * (x + 0.044715x^3)))* ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=def%20forward)).
  
The MLP thus consists of: Linear layer (n_embd -> 4*n_embd), GELU, then Linear (4*n_embd -> n_embd). In code, define two linear weight matrices (and biases if not using bias-less like GPT-2 did for second linear). With `tch::nn`, you can create `lin1 = nn::linear(p/"lin1", e, 4*e)` and `lin2 = nn::linear(p/"lin2", 4*e, e)`. Then forward pass: `x = lin1.forward(x).gelu()` then `x = lin2.forward(x)` ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20ys%20%3D)). Burn would be similar (or define as a sequence of layers). Don’t forget to apply dropout to the output of the MLP as well (GPT-2 uses dropout after each sub-layer). For example, tch code uses `dropout(cfg.resid_pdrop)` on both attention output and MLP output before adding residual ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=f64%3A%3ANEG_INFINITY)) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20ys%20%3D)).

### 4. **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections**
Each Transformer block uses *pre-normalization*: they apply LayerNorm to the input of the sub-layer, then the sub-layer computation, then add back the input (residual). So the sequence in one block is:
```
y = x + SelfAttention( LayerNorm(x) )
z = y + MLP( LayerNorm(y) )
```
- **LayerNorm:** Rust crates often have LayerNorm ready to use.
  - tch: `nn::layer_norm(p/"ln1", vec![e], Default::default())` returns a LayerNorm module for vectors of size `e` ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20ln1%20%3D%20nn%3A%3Alayer_norm,vec%21%5Bcfg.n_embd%5D%2C%20Default%3A%3Adefault)). You’d do `ln1.forward(x)` to normalize. It maintains trainable gain and bias parameters.
  - Burn: should have layer_norm as well.
  - Manual: implement LN by computing mean and variance for each position’s embedding vector and normalize. This is doable but ensure to get it right (subtract mean, divide stddev, then apply gamma and beta parameters).
  
- **Residual addition:** After attention, do `x = x + attn_out` ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=def%20forward)); after MLP, `x = x + mlp_out`. In code, ensure dimensions match and you’ve possibly applied dropout to `attn_out` and `mlp_out` if using dropout. This residual connection helps gradient flow and is standard in transformers.

Combining everything, a single **Transformer block** struct in Rust will contain: `ln1`, `ln2`, `attn` (our CausalSelfAttention struct), and `mlp` (the two linear layers and activation). Its forward does the sequence shown above ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=def%20forward)). We can instantiate an array or vector of these blocks of length `n_layer`.

### 5. **Assemble the Transformer Model**
Now, create the top-level `Transformer` model struct. It should include:
- The embedding layers (token and positional).
- The list of `n_layer` transformer blocks.
- Final layernorm (GPT-2 applies LayerNorm after the last block as well) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=h%20%3D%20nn.ModuleList%28,n_layer)).
- The output projection (lm_head) which is a linear map from `n_embd` to `vocab_size` ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=)). In Karpathy’s code, they tied the output projection weight with the input embedding (weight tying), but his implementation sets `lm_head` as a separate `nn.Linear`. You could optionally tie weights (save parameters), but it’s fine to keep separate for simplicity.

**Forward pass logic:** Taking a batch of index sequences (`idx` of shape `[B, T]` and maybe `targets` of same shape for training):
  1. Embed the indices: `tok_emb = token_embedding(idx)` producing `[B, T, n_embd]`.
  2. Create position indices (0..T-1) and embed them: `pos_emb = positional_embedding(positions)` producing `[1, T, n_embd]`.
  3. Sum them: `x = tok_emb + pos_emb` ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=,itself)).
  4. Loop through each block: `for block in blocks: x = block(x)` (each block will internally apply attention and MLP with residuals) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=for%20block%20in%20self)).
  5. Apply final layer norm: `x = ln_f(x)`.
  6. Compute logits: `logits = lm_head(x)` which has shape `[B, T, vocab_size]`. This is the prediction for each position’s next token.
  7. If `targets` (the true next tokens) are provided (training mode), compute the loss. Typically use cross-entropy loss: compare `logits[:, :-1, :]` with `targets[:, 1:]` if we shift, or in Karpathy’s code, he passes the targets aligned and uses an ignore index for the last token’s loss. With `tch`, use `tch::nn::cross_entropy_for_logits(logits.view(-1, vocab_size), targets.view(-1))`. Burn and others have similar loss functions.
  8. Return logits (and loss if computed).

In Rust, if using `tch`, much of this can use the same API calls as PyTorch (just in Rust style). For example, Karpathy’s forward essentially does exactly these steps ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=pos%20%3D%20torch,shape%20%281%2C%20t)) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=x%20%3D%20tok_emb%20%2B%20pos_emb)). The **good news** is that we do not need to modify the model architecture – we are reusing it as-is. We just need to carefully implement it with whatever crate. 

**Reusing vs. modifying components:** Most model components can be reused conceptually (embedding logic, attention computations, etc., remain the same equations). We might adjust minor details:
- If using Burn’s high-level API, you might write the model in a slightly different style (Burn might have its `Module` trait to implement).
- If implementing manually, you might avoid creating a combined QKV projection for simplicity and instead have separate weight matrices for Q, K, V – the result is the same, just minor difference in how code is structured.
- If you find memory or speed issues, you could adjust `block_size` or `n_layer` etc., but those are hyperparameters.
- Ensure to use proper initialization for weights. PyTorch’s `nn.Linear` and `nn.Embedding` have default init schemes (typically Xavier/uniform). `tch` and `burn` follow those defaults. If doing manually, use a reasonable init (small random values, e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean, 0.02 std, or something like Xavier uniform in [-1/sqrt(dim), 1/sqrt(dim)]). This helps training converge.

## Data Preparation and Loading
Karpathy’s project was trained on a simple text file (each line a name). We need to load this data and prepare it for training:

- **Reading the data:** Use Rust’s file I/O to read `names.txt`. You can use `std::fs::read_to_string` or iterate line by line using `BufReader`. Collect all lines into a `Vec<String>`.

- **Building vocabulary:** As mentioned, extract all unique characters. Include the newline character `'\n'` if you plan to use it as end-of-sequence. (In Karpathy’s Makemore, the newline serves as a token denoting end-of-name and separating names.) You might also decide to add a special start token like `<S>`; Karpathy often simply uses newline at both start and end as a sentinel. For simplicity, you can prepend each name with a special start token and have newline as end, or just use newline as both start and end (i.e., treat the sequence as `"\nName\n"` during training). The exact scheme isn’t too critical as long as the model sees some token to indicate a beginning.

- **Encoding sequences:** Convert each name (plus any start/end tokens) into a sequence of integer indices using the vocab map. e.g. "emma" -> [<start>, e, m, m, a, <end>] as indices.

- **Dataset splitting:** It’s often useful to split into training and validation sets. Karpathy’s code likely did an 90/10 split of the lines into train and test. We should do similarly to monitor overfitting. Shuffle and split the list of encoded sequences.

- **Batching strategy:** We have two main ways to create batches:
  1. **Same-length batches:** Pad or truncate sequences to a fixed length (the context length). For example, define `block_size = 32` (max context). For each name, if it’s shorter than block_size, you can pad with a special `<pad>` token or just note actual lengths. If longer, you may truncate (though for names, max length is probably below 32). Then you can batch multiple names together in a tensor [B, T]. This requires padding shorter sequences in the batch.
  2. **Continuous stream (language-model style):** Alternatively, as often done with text, you can concatenate all training examples with newline separators into one long sequence, and then take random chunks of length T from it as training samples. However, for distinct short sequences like names, this can sometimes introduce the model learning cross-sequence artifacts. It’s simpler to go with padded batches of individual sequences in this case.

For clarity, let’s assume we pad sequences to `block_size`. Use an index (e.g. -1 or a special token) for padding and ensure the loss function ignores the padding positions (in PyTorch they used `ignore_index=-1` in cross_entropy ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=if%20targets%20is%20not%20None%3A))). If using `tch::nn::CrossEntropyLoss`, set ignore_index accordingly so padded targets don’t count in loss.

- **DataLoader:** In Rust, you might not have a built-in DataLoader like PyTorch’s. If using `tch`, you can shuffle and batch manually. For example, collect all training sequences, and for each batch sample `batch_size` sequences, pad them, stack into a tensor. You can write an iterator or use rayon to parallelize loading if needed. There is a crate `linfa` or others for datasets, but it might be overkill. A simple approach is fine. If using `burn`, it offers a **Dataset** trait and you can use `burn::data::dataloader::DataLoader` to create batches, possibly with features like multithreading.

**Efficiency considerations:** It’s okay to load the entire dataset into memory since names list is small. If dataset were huge, you’d stream from disk in parts, but not needed here.

## Training Loop and Optimization

With the model and data ready, the next step is to train the Transformer on the data. The training loop in Rust will look conceptually similar to the PyTorch training loop ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=,it%20to%20input%20and%20target)) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=logits%2C%20loss%20%3D%20model)):

1. **Initialize model parameters** – if using `tch` or `burn`, this is done when you create the model (they handle random init). If manual, initialize your weight matrices as discussed.
2. **Choose an optimizer** – Karpathy used AdamW (Adam with weight decay) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=)). We should do the same for quick convergence. 
   - In `tch`, you can create an `nn::Optimizer` from a VarStore (which holds your model params). For example: 
     ```rust
     let mut opt = nn::AdamW::default().build(&vs, learning_rate)?;
     opt.set_weight_decay(weight_decay)?;
     ```
     This will update all parameters in `vs` (VarStore) except those in no_decay group (the tch example sets up two param groups for weight decay on weights but not on biases/LayerNorm gains ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=fn%20gpt,impl%20ModuleT))).
   - In `burn`, you can use `burn::optim::Adam` or `AdamW` with specified hyperparams. Burn will handle optimization for its Modules.
   - If manual, you’ll implement the update: for each weight `w`, `w = w - lr * grad`, and add weight decay as `w -= lr * wd * w`. This is more laborious; better to use an existing optimizer crate or simple Adam implementation if not using tch/burn’s optimizers.

3. **Training iterations:** Loop over epochs or (better) infinite loop or a large number of iterations:
   - Each iteration, get a batch of training data (a tensor of input indices and target indices).
   - Move data to GPU: in `tch`, call `.to(Device::Cuda(0))` on the tensors (if they aren’t already created on GPU). In `burn`, if your backend is WGPU, just ensure the tensors are on that backend (Burn might abstract this away so that if the model and data are created with WGPU backend, they’re already on GPU).
   - Set model to training mode (important if using dropout or other training-specific behavior). In tch, `ModuleT` functional modules have a `train` boolean flag in their forward. For example, the tch `blocks` were constructed and applied via `apply_t(&attn, train)` and `dropout(..., train)` which uses the `train` flag to decide whether to actually drop or not ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=f64%3A%3ANEG_INFINITY)) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=nn%3A%3Afunc_t%28move%20%7Cxs%2C%20train%7C%20)). If using `nn::Module` trait from tch directly, you might have to manage this. Burn’s forward methods might have a similar train/eval mode toggle or separate methods.
   - Forward pass: compute `logits, loss = model.forward(batch_inputs, batch_targets)`.
   - Backpropagate: call `.backward()` on the loss tensor to compute gradients (tch does this similar to PyTorch). Burn’s Tensors also support `backward()` (because it has autograd engine).
   - Update weights: step the optimizer (tch: `opt.step()?` and zero gradients with `opt.zero_grad()` or `model.zero_grad()`. Burn’s optimizer usage will differ but conceptually similar).
   - Monitor loss: print the loss value or other metrics every *n* iterations to track progress ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=if%20step%20,0)).
   - (Optional) Learning rate schedule: you might reduce LR after certain epochs, or use a warm-up. For simplicity, you could skip at first, or implement a simple decay.

Karpathy’s training loop also performed periodic evaluation on a test set and saved the best model ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=)) ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=,disk%20if%20it%20has%20improved)). You should consider doing this in Rust:
   - Evaluate on a validation batch (or small subset) every so often (say every 500 steps) to get a validation loss. This means running the model in eval mode (disable dropout) on data it hasn’t seen, and computing the loss.
   - If using `tensorboard-rs` or Burn’s logging, log training and validation loss curves for visualization ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=test_loss%20%3D%20evaluate,max_batches%3D10)).
   - Save checkpoints: e.g. if validation loss is the lowest so far, save the model weights to a file.

**Logging with TensorBoard:** It’s very useful to see training curves. You can integrate TensorBoard logging:
- Using **tensorboard-rs** crate: as shown in its example, create a `SummaryWriter` pointing to a log directory ([GitHub - pipehappy1/tensorboard-rs](https://github.com/pipehappy1/tensorboard-rs#:~:text=,one%20plot)). Each iteration (or every N iterations), do:
  ```rust
  writer.add_scalar("train/loss", loss_value, global_step);
  ```
  And similarly `writer.add_scalar("val/loss", val_loss, global_step)` when you evaluate. Don’t forget to `writer.flush()` periodically to ensure data is written to disk ([GitHub - pipehappy1/tensorboard-rs](https://github.com/pipehappy1/tensorboard-rs#:~:text=for%20n_iter%20in%200..100%20,%26map%2C%20n_iter%29%3B%20%7D%20writer.flush)). Then you can run `tensorboard --logdir <logdir>` to view.
- Burn has its own metrics and logging integration. If you use the Burn training loop (they have a `Learner` and `TrainOutput` structure that can log metrics), refer to Burn’s docs. But using tensorboard-rs manually is also fine with Burn – you’d still get the loss values and then call writer.

**Handling Device placement (tch specific):** In tch, you might create a `tch::Device` variable at start (e.g. `let device = Device::Cuda(0)` if GPU available, otherwise `Device::Cpu`). Then:
  - When creating model parameters via `nn::VarStore`, you can call `vs.to(device)` to put all parameters on GPU.
  - When loading data, convert the `Tensor` to the device as well (as mentioned).
  - This way, all ops happen on GPU. Tch will use the CUDA streams internally (the call `torch.cuda.synchronize()` Karpathy used ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=,then%20calculate%20iteration%20time%20taken)) is usually not needed explicitly in Rust, but you might do it if measuring time).

**Parallelism and performance:** If using tch or Burn, under the hood they use multi-threading and GPU parallelism. Just be mindful not to do things that sync GPU too often (like copying data back and forth in the inner loop). Ideally, keep data on the GPU, and only move small things (like loss value to CPU for printing) when needed. In tch, calling `.double_value()` or `.to_vec()` on a Tensor will sync. It’s fine to do for loss logging (cheap), just not in a tight inner loop excessively.

After each epoch or certain iterations, you might want to generate some sample outputs from the model to see how it’s doing (Karpathy’s script printed sample names occasionally during training). Let’s cover that next.

## Sampling / Text Generation 
Once the model is trained (or even during training to monitor progress), we’ll want to generate text (baby names in this case) from it. The procedure is to use the model in autoregressive **inference** mode:

**Greedy or random sampling?** You can either take the most likely next character at each step (greedy decoding) or sample from the probability distribution (stochastic sampling) to get varied outputs. Karpathy’s script did random sampling of names. We can do the same for creativity.

**Procedure:** To generate one name:
1. Start with an empty context (or a start token). For example, you can use `'\n'` as the start to indicate beginning of a new name.
2. Feed the context to the Transformer to get next-char probabilities:
   - In code, take a tensor `input_idxs` of shape `[1, T]` (batch size 1, T current length).
   - Get `logits = model.forward(input_idxs)` which gives `[1, T, vocab_size]`.
   - Extract the logits for the last time step `t = T-1`. That is `logits[0, T-1]`, a vector of size `vocab_size` for the next character.
   - Apply softmax to convert logits to probabilities (if using `tch`, `.softmax(-1, Kind::Float)` does this) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20q.matmul%28%26k.transpose%28,3%5D%20as%20f64)) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20att.softmax%28,train)). Or simpler, use `argmax` if doing greedy.
3. Sample a character:
   - If greedy: take `next_index = logits.argmax()` (or argmax of probabilities).
   - If random: treat the probabilities as a categorical distribution and draw a random index. You might need to convert the Rust tensor to a Rust array (`f32` slice) and use `rand` crate’s `WeightedIndex` or similar to sample according to probabilities.
4. Append this character (index) to the context sequence.
5. Stop if you generated an end-of-sequence token (e.g. newline `'\n'`) or if you hit a maximum length (to avoid infinite loop).
6. Repeat from step 2 with the new longer context.

Because our model has a fixed `block_size` context length, if the context grows beyond that, you have two choices: either stop (most names will be shorter than, say, 32 chars), or keep only the last `block_size-1` characters as context (i.e., slide the window). GPT-2 does the latter for long text generation. For names, you can probably set block_size high enough (e.g. 20 or 30) to include all reasonable lengths.

**Temperature and creativity:** You can introduce a temperature parameter when sampling: before sampling, you can divide the logits by some factor `temp` (>0). `temp < 1` makes distribution sharper (more greedy), `temp > 1` makes it flatter (more random). For example: `probs = (logits / temp).softmax()`. Additionally, you could implement nucleus/top-k sampling (choosing from top k tokens). Initially, you can skip these and just do simple sampling.

**Batch generation:** If you want many names at once, you could vectorize this by having batch size >1. However, generating sequentially is typically fine and easier to implement.

**Ensure model is in eval mode:** If you included dropout layers, be sure to disable them during generation:
  - In tch, you might call `model.set_train(false)` or simply ensure any dropout functions use `train=false`. If you coded the model yourself, just don’t apply dropout when sampling.
  - In burn, using the model outside of the training context should default to eval mode (check if burn requires an explicit flag).

**Example:** Suppose we want 5 sample names:
```rust
for i in 0..5 {
    let mut ctx = vec![vocab.char_to_idx['\n']]; // start token
    loop {
        let input = Tensor::of_slice(&ctx).unsqueeze(0).to(device);  // shape [1, len]
        let logits = model.forward(&input);  // (logits, None) if your forward returns tuple
        let logits_last = logits.i((0, -1, ..));  // shape [vocab_size]
        let probs = logits_last.softmax(-1, Kind::Float);
        let next_idx = sample_from_distribution(&probs);
        if next_idx == vocab.char_to_idx['\n'] || ctx.len() >= MAX_LEN {
            break;
        }
        ctx.push(next_idx);
    }
    // ctx now contains a full generated sequence of indices, including starting \n and ending \n.
    // Convert to characters (skip the starting \n for printing).
    let name: String = ctx[1..ctx.len()]  // skip first token
                      .iter()
                      .map(|&i| vocab.idx_to_char[i])
                      .collect();
    println!("{}", name);
}
```
(This is conceptual code – actual usage might differ slightly based on how you structured `model.forward` and device management.)

**Main binary (`main.rs`)**: This will be the entry point. You can use `clap` or any arg parser to allow running in different modes. For example, similar to Karpathy’s usage: `--train` vs `--sample-only`. In train mode, it calls functions to load data, train the model, etc. In sample mode, it loads a saved model checkpoint and generates outputs. The main can also handle hyperparameter definitions (learning rate, n_embd, n_head, n_layer, etc., possibly via config or flags).

**Model module (`model.rs`)**: Contains struct definitions for `Transformer`, `Block`, `CausalSelfAttention` and maybe `Config` (to hold hyperparams like `vocab_size, block_size, n_layer, n_embd, n_head, dropout`). Implement the forward pass methods here. If using `tch`, this is where you use tch’s `nn::Module` trait or just imperative style with Tensors. If using burn, you might derive `burn::module::Module` for your struct or use their macro to define modules.

**Dataset module (`dataset.rs`)**: Functions to load the text file and convert it into training and validation tensors. Could include a struct `CharDataset` that holds the vocabulary and data, and an iterator for batches.

**Train module (`train.rs`)**: The training loop logic as discussed, written in a structured way. This might also include evaluation code (for val set) and maybe checkpoint saving code. You can save the model using:
  - tch: `vs.save("model.ot")` to save all weights to a file (the `.ot` format is a custom format tch uses; alternatively use `.save` on each tensor or `Tensor::write_npz` to save as .npz).
  - burn: uses its own checkpoint serializer (check burn docs, possibly `Checkpoint::new(...).save(model)`).
  - or implement a simple format (write weights as numpy arrays using `ndarray` crate if you went that route, or even JSON/bincode for small models).
  
**Generate module (`generate.rs`)**: Could contain the sampling function and perhaps a `main()` function if you decide to compile a separate binary for generation. But it’s fine to keep a function `generate_samples(model, vocab, n_samples)` that main can call when `--sample-only` is set.

**Utils module (`utils.rs`)**: Any miscellaneous helpers, e.g., a function to set up the `tensorboard-rs::SummaryWriter`, or a timing utility, etc. If using tch, perhaps a helper to move a tensor to device.

*(The above structure is flexible – adapt as needed. The key is to separate concerns for clarity.)*

## Rust Transformer Resources and Examples

To aid your implementation, it’s valuable to study existing Rust projects and documentation:

- **Karpathy’s Makemore (Python)** – While not Rust, keep this as a reference for expected behavior. It’s one file, `makemore.py`, which you can refer to for any logic doubts (e.g., how he did data loading or sampling).
- **tch-rs Examples** – The `tch` repository has an example called *min-gpt* (analogous to a mini GPT-2) in Rust ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=nn%3A%3Afunc_t%28move%20%7Cxs%2C%20train%7C%20)) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=fn%20gpt,impl%20ModuleT)). It implements a transformer with tch and is very close to what we want. Studying [`tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs`](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs) will show how to define the model using `nn::Linear`, `nn::layer_norm`, etc., how to apply masks, and how to do the training loop with tch. Key sections to look at: the `causal_self_attention` function and the `block` definition in that file (which correspond to our Attention and Block) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20att%20%3D%20q.matmul%28%26k.transpose%28,3%5D%20as%20f64)) ([tch-rs/examples/min-gpt/main.rs at main · LaurentMazare/tch-rs · GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs/blob/main/examples/min-gpt/main.rs#:~:text=let%20ys%20%3D)).
- **Burn Documentation and Examples** – Visit [burn.dev](https://burn.dev) for guides. Burn has example projects (e.g., text classification and generation) and a “Burn Book” illustrating how to use the API. In particular, see if Burn has a transformer or language model example in their repo or docs (they were working on a port of HuggingFace transformers to Burn ([bkonkle/burn-transformers: A WIP port of the HuggingFace ... - GitHub](https://github.com/bkonkle/burn-transformers#:~:text=bkonkle%2Fburn,library%20from%20Python%20to%20Rust))). That could give insight into using Burn for this project. Burn’s design might allow you to define the transformer in a more declarative way (similar to how you’d do in PyTorch but pure Rust).
- **femtoGPT (Keyvan Kambakhsh’s project)** – [femtoGPT](https://github.com/keyvank/femtoGPT) is a minimal GPT implementation in Rust (CPU-only, pure Rust). It was built from scratch for learning purposes. You can use it as a reference to validate your understanding of the math. For instance, see how they implement multi-head attention and backprop. This can be enlightening if you chose the ndarray/manual route. (There’s also a blog post “Train your own minimal GPT in Rust” by the author ([Train your own minimal GPT language model in Rust | by Keyvan Kambakhsh | GoPenAI](https://blog.gopenai.com/train-your-own-minimal-gpt-language-model-in-rust-b53a9177973a#:~:text=operations%20and%20Rust%E2%80%99s%20native%20math,small%20GPT%20models%20on%20CPU)) ([Train your own minimal GPT language model in Rust | by Keyvan Kambakhsh | GoPenAI](https://blog.gopenai.com/train-your-own-minimal-gpt-language-model-in-rust-b53a9177973a#:~:text=You%20might%20say%20I%E2%80%99m%20crazy%2C,hugely%20increased%20my%20skills%20and)) describing lessons learned.)
- **Rust-BERT and Candle** – HuggingFace’s [`rust-bert`](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert) uses `tch` to provide pretrained transformer models in Rust. While it’s more for inference, exploring its code can show a high-quality example of organizing transformer code with tch. Similarly, HF’s [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) is a newer framework focusing on minimalism and performance (using kernels like cuDNN under the hood). Candle has examples of loading and running GPT models. These might not be directly used for training our own model, but they represent the state-of-the-art Rust usage in 2025.
- **Forums and Community** – The Rust ML community (e.g., users on the Rust Discord or r/rust subreddit) is active. If you run into issues, don’t hesitate to ask. By 2025, tools like Burn are quite new, so sharing experiences is common. The [Rust Machine Learning subreddit discussion comparing Candle vs Burn vs tch ([Choosing the Right Rust Machine Learning Framework: Candle, Burn, DFDX, or tch-rs? | by Athan X | Medium](https://medium.com/@athan.seal/choosing-the-right-rust-machine-learning-framework-candle-burn-dfdx-or-tch-rs-17501f6cd765#:~:text=1,rs)) ([Choosing the Right Rust Machine Learning Framework: Candle, Burn, DFDX, or tch-rs? | by Athan X | Medium](https://medium.com/@athan.seal/choosing-the-right-rust-machine-learning-framework-candle-burn-dfdx-or-tch-rs-17501f6cd765#:~:text=3,their%20reliance%20on%20external%20libraries))](https://medium.com/@athan.seal/choosing-the-right-rust-machine-learning-framework-candle-burn-dfdx-or-tch-rs-17501f6cd765) can give a sense of each library’s strengths.

## Final Tips (Modern Rust & GPU Best Practices)

- **Leverage safe abstractions:** Rust’s strong type system can help avoid shape mismatches or uninitialized values. For example, if using the `ndarray` route, consider using dimension types (ndarray’s `Ix2`, `Ix3`) and assertions to ensure shapes line up (e.g. check that your head_size multiplication equals n_embd, etc.). If using higher-level crates, trust their interfaces to some extent – they’re designed to prevent common mistakes.
- **Memory management:** When training on GPU, watch memory usage. If the GPU is limited, you might need to reduce batch size or model size. The `tch` crate allows checking CUDA memory usage (though not as straightforward as in Python). In extreme cases, you could implement gradient checkpointing or split the model on multiple devices, but that’s likely unnecessary for a 200K-param model.
- **Parallelizing data loading:** If training on a large dataset, you’d typically load batches on a separate thread. Karpathy’s `InfiniteDataLoader` uses multiple worker threads ([makemore/makemore.py at master · karpathy/makemore · GitHub](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore/blob/master/makemore.py#:~:text=)). In Rust, you can spawn threads or use rayon for this. Given our dataset is small (names list), this is not critical, but keep it in mind for bigger projects.
- **Alignment with 2025 ecosystem:** WebGPU (via wgpu) is stable now – so Burn’s use of it is cutting-edge and likely to improve. Also, newer GPUs and libraries might support mixed precision (FP16/BF16) for faster training. `tch` crate might let you cast tensors to half precision. Burn might add automatic mixed precision in the future. For learning, stick to float32 first, but be aware of these trends.
- **Testing the model:** After implementing, run a forward pass with a tiny dummy input to verify dimensions. Also, overfit the model on a tiny subset (say 5 names) for a few hundred iterations – it should be able to learn to output those 5 names (loss should go to near 0). This sanity check ensures your implementation is correct. If it can’t overfit a small sample, something’s off (bug in dimensions, learning rate issues, etc.).
- **When to implement from scratch:** If your goal is to **deeply learn**, you might implement the first transformer block’s forward and backward manually on CPU (even verifying gradients by numeric approximation). However, doing that for the entire model and training is a massive endeavor. Consider a hybrid approach: use the high-level crates to get a baseline working model (so you know it converges and learn how to use the library), and separately, as a side project, implement a micro-version (maybe smaller embedding and only 1 head) from scratch to truly see the guts of backprop. This two-pronged approach can solidify understanding without derailing the main project.

By following this plan and utilizing the rich Rust ML ecosystem, you’ll end up with a Rust implementation of Karpathy’s Transformer that is efficient and maintains the clarity of the original. You’ll also gain experience in GPU programming in Rust – either through the convenience of crates like tch/burn or through optional low-level exploration. Good luck, and have fun **“making more”** names (or other text) with your Rust-powered Transformer!
